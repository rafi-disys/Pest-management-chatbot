Title: Aphids in Sesame
Authors: G.   Sudhakar
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    These are a major pest on sesame and pulses,
and are commonly known as aphids (Asuvini in Tamil). Aphids can cause 10-15%
yield loss in sesame, also known as gingelly. The nymphs and yellow-coloured adults
suck the plant sap. As a result of this, the crop growth is stunted and the
flowering and pod setting are affected. Typical symptoms of the damage caused
by this insect are yellowish discoloration and crinkling of leaves. The damage is
more severe in young shoots and buds.
    Aphids are found in groups on the under
surface of the leaves, tender shoots and growing tips. Ants are attracted to the
honey dew secretion that aphids release and can help in carrying the aphids
from one plant to another plant.

Title: Brown Planthopper
Authors: S.   Malarvannan
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The brown planthopper is a major
problem on rice, particularly in low land. In Tamil Nadu, it is known as
&ldquo;Pugaiyan&rdquo;. The adult has a brown body and chestnut brown eyes. Two forms of
panthopper, namely long winged and short winged, are seen. As a result of
feeding by both nymphs and adults at the base of the tillers, plants turn
yellow and dry up rapidly. This condition is called 'hopper burn', in which
circular patches of drying and lodging of matured plants is seen. If timely
control measures are not adopted it may cause up to 60% crop loss.
    The insect infests the rice crop at
all stages of plant growth. Nymphs and adults congregate at the base of the
plant above the water level. They damage rice directly through feeding and also
by transmitting two viruses, rice ragged stunt virus and rice grassy stunt
virus. Excessive use of&nbsp;urea&nbsp;and
certain chemicals can lead to outbreak by increasing the&nbsp;egg laying of the brown plant hopper
and by reducing populations of natural enemies.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Grow resistant/
    tolerant varieties like ADT 36, Co 46, Co 42, IR 36, Aruna</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Provide 30 cm
    rogue spacing at every 2.5 m to reduce the pest incidence. Avoid the use of
    excessive nitrogenous fertilizers. Control irrigation by intermittent draining.
    Grow Azolla to increase wolf spider population, which will control BPH.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Set up light
    traps @ 5 / acre between 7-9 pm. Install 20 yellow pan traps during the day
    time</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Conserve
    natural enemies like wolf spider, mirid bugs etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid chemicals
    like fenthion and quinalphos which can cause resurgence of the pest</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>If the pest
    persists after adopting the above management practices then chemical control
    may be necessary. Drain water from the field then spray any one of the
    following chemicals: buprofezin 25% EC @ 625 ml/ha, imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 100
    ml/ha, thiamethoxam 20 % WDG @ 100 g/ha, neem oil 3% @ 15 lit/ha or 25 kg of neem

Title: Chickpea Pod Borer
Authors: K. P Singh, S. A Pachkawade
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Female moths of the pod borer each lay about 300-350
eggs on the tender leaves and flower bracts of the plant. The eggs are creamy
white in colour. The incubation period is
4-5 days and the larval period is 22-27 days. Newly hatched
larvae feed on green leaves and later feed on flower buds and pods. Fully
grown larvae feed on the pods by making small circular holes. Half of the larvae body always remains outside
the pods. A single larva can damage up to 50-60 pods during its larval period.
    The chickpea pod borer causes serious
damage to chickpea crops with yield losses of up
to 50%. The infestation usually starts
on chickpea a fortnight after germination and becomes serious just after the
initiation of flower buds, especially when
coupled
with cloudy and humid weather.

Title: Button Shedding in Coconut
Authors: S.   Malarvannan
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Premature
button shedding is a very common problem observed on coconut. Buttons can be
shed after fertilization and some nuts are shed after setting. This is not
due to a single cause but may be due to combination of one or more factors.
The economic loss ranges from 10 to 20%.
    Shedding
of buttons and premature nuts may be due to one or more of the following:
excess acidity or alkalinity, poor drainage facilities, severe and prolonged
drought, genetic disorders, insufficient nutrients, improper pollination,
hormone deficiency, insect pests or poor management practices.
    The
following remedial measures can be followed to effectively manage this
problem:-
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rectification
    of soil pH</strong>-Excess acidity or alkalinity of soil may
    cause button shedding. If the soil pH is less than 5.5, the soil is too
    acidic. This could be overcome by adding lime. High alkalinity is indicated
    by soil pH higher than 8.0. This situation could be managed by adding gypsum.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of nutrition</strong>-Button
    shedding can occur as a result of inadequate manuring. The recommended dose
    of manurial schedules and proper time of application are important to
    minimise the button shedding. Soil application of 1.3 Kg urea, 2 Kg of Single
    Super Phosphate and 2 Kg of potash, mixed with 50 Kg of farmyard manure per
    palm. This can be followed by root feeding of Coconut tonic @ 40 ml in 160 ml
    of water per palm once in 6 months which will control the button shedding and
    enhance the yield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Irrigation management</strong>- Button
    shedding will be severe during March-April. Severe drought and / or
    insufficient irrigation aggravate the problem. Soil mulching with green
    fronds reduces evapo-transpiration and conserves soil moisture. Ensuring
    sufficient irrigation during summer and drainage during winter will lead to a
    sustainable yield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hormone deficiency</strong>- Apply 0.5 ml
    of NAA (Planofix) mixed in 1 litre of water on the inflorescence. This
    prevents button shedding.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pests and Diseases</strong>- When young
    buttons are formed sucking pests start infesting which in turn attracts secondary
    fungal infections. Apply the recommended plant protection measures to ward
    off the problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Boron deficiency or crown chokes disorder:</strong> Apply 200g of
    borax/palm/year in two splits.</li>
</ul>
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Citrus Canker
Authors: Bhavana   Kolhe
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Citrus
canker affects all above ground parts of the citrus tree. Rusty-brown spots called
cankers form on the leaves, twigs and shoots. The cankers on leaves develop a
distinctive bright yellow halo around them. Scabby cankers also appear on the
fruit. When conditions are highly favourable for infection, the disease can
cause shoot dieback, leaf drop and premature fruit drop. Growth of young trees
is severely affected because of the damage to new shoots.
    The
disease is caused by bacteria which attack the fruit, leaves and twigs of citrus.
Windbreaks help to reduce the wind speed and so lower the probability of
bacteria directly penetrating the stomata of the leaves. They also help to
reduce entry of bacteria via wind-induced injuries on foliage and fruit.

Sections:
    Psyllids are a serious
sucking pest of citrus. Psyllids extract large quantities of sap from the
plants, especially from new flush and flower buds. This causes curling of the leaves, distortion of shoots and
even stops growth. While sucking the sap, nymphs inject a
toxin that causes the plant tips to
dieback. A sugary substance coats the leaves. This may also be
found on the ground below the affected plant parts,
indicating heavy incidence of the pest. Brownish
adult citrus psyllids can be seen sitting in a row on the tender leaves. Heavy
infestation causes bud and fruit drop. Quality and quantity of fruit is
affected.

Title: Coconut Basal Stem End Rot
Authors: R.   Rajkumar
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    This chronic problem was first noticed in
Tanjore in Tamil Nadu and hence is sometimes known as Tanjore wilt disease. It
later spread to all coconut growing tracts of India. In the initial stages of
the disease, profuse bearing of nuts is noticed. The characteristic symptoms of
the disease are the exudation of reddish brown liquid through cracks, stem
discolouration and internal rotting up to the height of bleeding. In later
stages of the infestation, the decaying of tissues at the bleeding point and
the basal portion of the stem is observed and a reduction in nut size and nut
yield is seen. In rare cases, the bark of the stem peels off and causes
complete collapse of tree.
    This disease is caused by a fungus and can
cause an economic loss of up to 80%. It spreads mainly through root contact and
irrigation between diseased and healthy palms. Repeated ploughing and
uncontrolled flood irrigation also favours infection.

This chronic problem was first noticed in
Tanjore in Tamil Nadu and hence is sometimes known as Tanjore wilt disease. It
later spread to all coconut growing tracts of India. In the initial stages of
the disease, profuse bearing of nuts is noticed. The characteristic symptoms of
the disease are the exudation of reddish brown liquid through cracks, stem
discolouration and internal rotting up to the height of bleeding. In later

Title: Cotton Whitefly
Authors: Charudatta D Thipse
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Whiteflies
suck sap from the cotton leaves, causing leaves to curl upwards. The leaves
turn pale yellow and have reduced vigour. The upper surface of the lower leaves
becomes shiny with a sugary secretion from the insect. Growth of black sooty

with these secretions.
    The
incidence of whiteflies is at its peak from September to November. We can see
the tiny whiteflies with milky white colour wings and yellow bodies sitting on

Title: Deficiency of Magnesium in Cotton Plant
Authors: Vaishali   Londase
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Magnesium is an
essential secondary nutrient&nbsp;making up&nbsp;0.2-0.4% of dry matter of cotton plants. It
is necessary for normal plant growth and is a core element in the chlorophyll molecules. In cotton
plants, magnesium deficiency appears first on the lower leaves in which green
leaves turns purple in colour. The middle and the older leaves turn red in
colour. The plant becomes stunted in appearance and its yield is reduced.
    Magnesium
(Mg) deficiency&nbsp;is a detrimental plant disorder that occurs most often in
strongly acidic, light and sandy soils where magnesium gets easily leached
away.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Due to the deficiency of magnesium, plants begin to degrade the
    chlorophyll in older leaves. To reduce this, use organic
    manure and compost manure.</li>

Title: Fruit Rot and Dieback in Chillies
Authors: S.   Malarvannan
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Chilli fruit rot and dieback is a fungal
problem witnessed globally. This disease is observed at the flowering stage of
chilli growth. Flowers dry up resulting in
profuse shedding. The flower stalk shrivels. This drying up spreads from the flower stalks to the stem, resulting in dieback
of the branches and stem. The fungus causes necrosis of tender twigs
from the tip backwards, hence the name dieback. The branches wither. Partially affected plants bear a few fruits
which are of low quality.
    This is a fungal disease
which occurs on many vegetable crops but is most severe on chillies. If action is
not taken, the farmer will end up with poor and marginal crops. Seed treatments
are effective in
eliminating the seed-borne inoculum. Chemicals like zineb, copper oxychloride
and wettable sulphur not only reduce the disease incidence but also increase the
yield of fruits.
    <ul>
    <li>Use disease
    free seeds</li>
    <li>Use a seed
    treatment with <em>Trichoderma viride</em>
    @10g/kg to manage the disease in a biological way</li>
    <li>Alternatively,
    use a chemical seed treatment of thiram or captan 4g/kg</li>
    <li>Good control of
    the disease has been reported by spraying ziram 0.25%, captan 0.2% or a
    combination of zineb and copper oxychloride (e.g. Miltox 0.2%) three times</li>
    <li>The first
    spraying should be given just before flowering and the second at the time of
    fruit formation. The third spraying may be given a fortnight after second
    spraying</li>
</ul>
<p>
The chemical
control options above should be used&nbsp;as an alternative to biological seed treatment, not
as well as, to avoid killing the biocontrol agent <em>Trichoderma</em>.</p>

Title: Green Semilooper in Soybean
Authors: S. A Pachkawade
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The semilooper larva is green in colour with several
thin light lines running the length of the body. When crawling, it forms a
characteristic loop or hump so is known as the semilooper. The full grown larva
feeds on foliage, flowers and pods. In severe infestation, it defoliates the
plant leaving behind only midribs. The female moth lays tiny white creamy eggs
on the underside of the leaves or young stems. The eggs hatch 3-4 days later.
The newly emerged caterpillars feed on the lower surface of the upper canopy of
soybean leaves in a characteristic manner, leaving the top epidermis intact.
    The
semilooper feeds on soybean crops and causes yield losses up to 30-40%. It
affects the crop at the vegetative stage and if the infestation is at the
podding or flowering stage, it can cause considerable yield losses. Usually the
infestation occurs before late August and early September.

Title: Maize Stem Borer
Authors: R.   Rajkumar
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The young maize stem
borer larvae are yellow brown in colour with a brown head. The larva feeds on
the leaves by making a few &ldquo;shot holes&rdquo; and then boring its way downwards
through the central whorl. It may also cause internal tunnels by entering into
the midribs and feeding on the internal tissues. The characteristic symptoms
are &ldquo;shot holes&rdquo; during early stage and &ldquo;dead heart&rdquo; during severe attack.
Severe damage will result in breaking of the stem, and stunted growth is widely reported.
Larvae pupate inside the stem. The adult moth is medium sized and straw
coloured.
    This is one of the most serious
pests of maize and requires immediate control measures if noticed. The insect
damage occurs mostly during the months of April to October.

The young maize stem
borer larvae are yellow brown in colour with a brown head. The larva feeds on
the leaves by making a few &ldquo;shot holes&rdquo; and then boring its way downwards
through the central whorl. It may also cause internal tunnels by entering into
the midribs and feeding on the internal tissues. The characteristic symptoms
are &ldquo;shot holes&rdquo; during early stage and &ldquo;dead heart&rdquo; during severe attack.
Severe damage will result in breaking of the stem, and stunted growth is widely reported.
Larvae pupate inside the stem. The adult moth is medium sized and straw
coloured. This is one of the most serious
pests of maize and requires immediate control measures if noticed. The insect
damage occurs mostly during the months of April to October. <ul>

Title: Management of Uniformity in Size of Bulbs in Onion
Authors: Gulbir    Singh
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Non-uniformity in bulb size of onion is a very big problem
which leads to economic loss to the farmers. Non-uniform bulbs are difficult to
store for marketing. The difference in size does not attract a good value for
the crop in the market. Hence, the uniformity in size of onion bulbs is very
important.
    Uniformity
in maturity plays a very important role in bulb size and storage quality. Onion
is a moderate weather crop and should be planted early to attain the largest
bulb size. Selecting the correct
variety and understanding the climatic and other environmental factors that
affect its performance is extremely important.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Adequate light and frequent irrigation should be
    used when onions are small to minimize leaching of nitrogen from the root zone</li>
    <li>Application of optimum fertilizer is essential
    for top quality and yields</li>
    <li>Proper moisture management is important in
    alleviating pink root problems, general root health, and therefore bulb growth vigour</li>
    <li>Maintaining an even soil moisture is important in
    reducing incidence of double-centre bulbs</li>
    <li>Spray Chlormequat chloride, e.g. Lihocin 50% / CCC
    at 0.5 ml per litre of water 60 and 75 days after transplanting seedlings to
    help maintain the size of the bulbs</li>
</ul>
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Nutrient Deficiency
Authors: S. G Matale
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Stresses such as soil salinity, pathogens and air pollution induce their
own characteristic set of visual symptoms. These symptoms closely resemble
those of nutrient deficiency. Pathological symptoms can often be separated from
nutritional symptoms by their distribution in a population of affected plants.
If the plants are under a nutrient stress, all plants of a given type and age
in the same environment tend to develop similar symptoms at the same time. To
study the exact cause of the disease, plant parts are to be examined for the
following:<br>
</br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific
nutritional problem for deficiency
<br>
</br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutrient
requirement of the crop
<br>
</br>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concentration
of nutrients for the recommendations
    Visible nutrient
deficiency symptoms can be a very powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating the
nutrient status of plants. Many of the classic deficiency symptoms such as tip
burn, chlorosis and necrosis are characteristically associated with more than
one mineral deficiency and also with other stresses that by themselves are not diagnostic
for any specific nutrient stress. Their detection is extremely useful in making
an evaluation of nutrient status. The nutrients used by and available to crops
must be balanced.
    <ul>
    <li>Proper
    nutrients should be provided to the plant</li>
    <li>To
    advise the recommendation, the mature plant parts should be sent for analysis</li>
    <li>Correct
    growth stage and time are the most crucial things in plant analysis. Plant parts
    that correlate with the yield should be selected.</li>
    <li>Different
    methods are adopted to prepare plant samples for analysis. These are total leaf
    analysis, pot culture and tissue testing.</li>
    <li>The
    plant samples should be well processed through standard method to avoid any
    contamination.</li>

Sections:
    Rice blast is one of the most important diseases of rice
and is caused by a fungus. A typical blast wound on a rice leaf is grey at the
centre, has a dark border, and is spindle-shaped, i.e. large in the middle and smaller
towards the ends.
    This disease is also known as &lsquo;rice fever&rsquo;. The pathogen
may infect all the aboveground parts of a rice plant at different growth
stages: leaf, collar, node, internode, base, or neck and other parts of the
panicle, and sometimes the leaf sheath. Among them, leaves and neck infections
are more severe. The infection will be more during rainy season.The disease
will cause severe yield loss (up to 70-80%) to the paddy crop.

Title: Papaya Mealybug
Authors: K.   Soundary
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Papaya mealybug infestations are typically
observed as clusters of cotton-like masses on the above-ground portion of
plants. The adult female is yellow and covered with a white waxy coating. The
papaya mealybug feeds on the sap of plants by inserting its mouthparts, called
stylets, into the leaf epidermis, fruit and stem. This results in chlorosis,
plant stunting, leaf deformation, early leaf and fruit drop, a heavy build up
of honeydew, and the death of the plant. Heavy infestations are capable of
rendering fruit inedible due to the build up of thick white wax.
    Mealybugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts
and feed by inserting these mouthparts into plant tissue and sucking the plant
sap. The papaya mealybug is polyphagous and has been recorded on 55 host plants
in more than 25 genera. Economically important host plants of the papaya mealy
bug include papaya, hibiscus, avocado, citrus, cotton, tomato, eggplant,
peppers, beans, peas, sweet potato, mango, cherry and pomegranate. Papaya mealybugs
have only been recorded feeding on areas of the host plant that are above
ground, such as leaves and fruits.

lesions on their surface.
    Tomato
seedlings that are raised in nurseries before being transplanted into the field
can be attacked by Phytophthora. The pathogen lives in the soil and can persist
for more than 10 years. If this disease is not controlled in the nursery, it could
cause huge yield loss. The seedlings should be planted in very well drained

Title: Pigeon Pea Pod Borer
Authors: Vijay S Thokre
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The pod borer is a major pest of pigeon pea. Its
population directly affects the yield. Infestation starts from 90 days after
sowing. The females lay eggs in all parts of the plant. The eggs are yellowish
and shiny. It feeds on leaves at the initial stage and then later on the pods. The
larva thrusts its head inside the pods and leaves the rest of its body hanging
out. Round holes appear on the pods. Larval colour changes accordingly to their
feeding habitat.
    It is a polyphagous pest observed on various crops. The economic
threshold level (ETL) of the pest is 1 larva per plant. 1 larva of this pest
causes about 138 kg yield loss.

Title: Rat control in Paddy
Authors: Mr   Murugan
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Rats
pose a real problem and challenge to Indian agriculture. The outbreaks that
occurred periodically in the past have brought limitless miseries in terms of
food shortages and loss of livelihood among farmers. Rats inflict extensive
damage to rice in all stages of growth. Yearly yield loss may range from 5% -60%.
    Generally, rat damage is higher in the wet
season than in the dry&nbsp;season.
Rat damage occurs at all stages of rice growth but reaches its peak&nbsp;while grain is maturing. Increased
damage is due to greater numbers of rats when there is increased&nbsp;cover (rice plants, weeds, etc.) and
available food (rice). Field rats survive by eating frogs, snails, etc. during
non-rice periods, making them difficult to manage.

Title: Rhinoceros Beetle in Coconut
Authors: Ms.    Girija
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The Rhinoceros
beetle is a black-coloured
horned beetle which is active at night and hides in feeding
or breeding sites during the day. The beetle attacks the young leaf fronds which,
when fully opened, show characteristic
diamond shaped cuts. Repeated attack can destroy the top portion resulting in
the death of the palm.
    The adult beetles from the manure pits
or the nearby trees bore into the opened fronds of the young palms and cause
damage. The rhinoceros beetle feeds on young growing tissue and eats the exuded sap. The grubs of the beetle are
usually found in manure pits.

Sections:
    This problem is caused by an insect. It is commonly known
as rice stem borer or yellow rice borer. Typical bore holes will be seen on the
stem. Usually one larva is seen inside the stem. It remains inside the stem and
feeds on the internal contents. The shoot of the affected plant can be pulled
off easily, a symptom known as dead heart. At maturity, the grains become chaffy,
which is known as white ear. The whole plant finally dies.
<br>
</br>
The yellow adult moth has a black spot on its wings so
is easy to identify. It lays eggs in masses on the leaf tips.
    Rice stem borer is a major problem on rice.
If timely control measures are not adapted it may cause a crop loss of 30%. This
is a major pest that is noticed both in the nursery as well as in the main
field. During the off season, it survives on weed hosts. It does not transmit
plant diseases.

Title: Soybean Girdle Beetle
Authors: Charudatta D Thipse
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The
incidence of girdle beetles is observed at the seedling stage. The presence of 2
circular cuts on the branch or stem is a characteristic symptom. Larvae bore
into the stem of soybean. The inside of the stem is eaten by the larvae,
forming tunnels within the stem. The infected portion above the circular cut is
unable to get any nutrition so it dries up. In the later stages of infestation,
the plant is severed at about 15 to 25 cm above the ground.
    The
main damage is caused by the larvae of the insect. The attack of the insect
initially begins in the last week of July to the first fortnight of August. The
insect remains active from July to October, damaging the crop most severely
during August and September. Heavy incidence may reduce the yield by up to 40%.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Practice deep summer ploughing</li>
    <li>Sow the crop at the proper time i.e. at the onset of
    monsoon, with the recommended seed rate of 75 kg/ha. The crop should not be
    overcrowded</li>
    <li>Sow tolerant varieties such as NRC-12 or NRC-7</li>
    <li>Avoid excess nitrogenous fertilizers</li>
    <li>Destroy crop residues</li>
    <li>Collect and destroy infested plant parts at least once
    every 10 days</li>
    <li>Apply pesticides if pest population crosses the
    Economic Threshold Level (5 per cent damaged plants)</li>
    <li>Spray NSKE 5% or azadirachtin 10,000 ppm @1 ml per 1
    litre of water to avoid the pest laying eggs</li>

Content:
The
incidence of girdle beetles is observed at the seedling stage. The presence of 2
circular cuts on the branch or stem is a characteristic symptom. Larvae bore
into the stem of soybean. The inside of the stem is eaten by the larvae,
forming tunnels within the stem. The infected portion above the circular cut is
unable to get any nutrition so it dries up. In the later stages of infestation,
the plant is severed at about 15 to 25 cm above the ground. The
main damage is caused by the larvae of the insect. The attack of the insect
initially begins in the last week of July to the first fortnight of August. The
insect remains active from July to October, damaging the crop most severely
during August and September. Heavy incidence may reduce the yield by up to 40%. <ul>
    <li>
    Practice deep summer ploughing</li>
    <li>Sow the crop at the proper time i.e. at the onset of
    monsoon, with the recommended seed rate of 75 kg/ha. The crop should not be
    overcrowded</li>
    <li>Sow tolerant varieties such as NRC-12 or NRC-7</li>
    <li>Avoid excess nitrogenous fertilizers</li>
    <li>Destroy crop residues</li>
    <li>Collect and destroy infested plant parts at least once
    every 10 days</li>
    <li>Apply pesticides if pest population crosses the
    Economic Threshold Level (5 per cent damaged plants)</li>
    <li>Spray NSKE 5% or azadirachtin 10,000 ppm @1 ml per 1
    litre of water to avoid the pest laying eggs</li>

Title: Spodoptera in Soybean
Authors: K. P Singh
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Spodoptera
larvae feed on the soybean crop and can cause considerable yield losses. Two
black spots are present on the second segment of the larva. The female lays
eggs in masses on the surface of the leaves and covers them with whitish hair
scales. The egg stage lasts for 3 days. The newly emerged caterpillars feed on
the lower surface of soybean leaves, skeletonising the lower surface of leaves,
so that only the top epidermis is left intact. Spodoptera larvae undergo
several colour changes from green to almost black in the mature stages. Large
larvae can feed on the whole plant.
    Spodoptera
larvae affect the crop at the vegetative stage and if the infestation is at
flowering or podding stage, they can cause yield losses of up to 60%. The
infestation mainly occurs before late August and early September.

Title: Banana Stem Weevil
Authors: Manju   Thakur
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The banana stem weevil
attacks the plant during flowering and bunch formation stages and causes severe
yield loss by preventing bunch development. The early symptom which indicates
weevil and grub activity is the presence of jelly exudation on the banana
stem. Due to feeding by grubs, the pseudostem becomes hollow and can even
break at the apical region after a gush of wind. The grubs cause more damage
by making long tunnels in the pseudostem. This results in yellowing and
withering of leaves, exudation of sap from leaf sheaths, decaying of
peduncles and immature ripening of fruits.
    The pest
incidence is at its peak during summer and monsoon seasons. The attack
usually starts about four months after planting, which coincides with the
initiation of the peduncle in the growing plants.

feed mostly during the night under the protective covering of webbing
consisting partly of frays, feacal pellets and silken threads secreted by the
larvae, and remain hidden during the day time. As a result of their feeding on
the bark, the sap conducting tissues are damaged. The vigor of the plant is reduced and the yield and quality of fruits are
adversely affected.
    This is often a serious
pest on citrus, particularly in South India. The eggs are laid in the months of May and June in groups of 15, which
are glued to the bark. A single female lays as many as 624 eggs with an average
of about 350. The eggs hatch after 8 to 11 days. On hatching, the larvae live
under the bark until September when they tunnel in to the wood.<br>

Title: Citrus Leaf Miner
Authors: Sachin    Matale
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The problem is caused by an insect called a leaf
miner. As the name implies, the larvae mine into the tender leaves and sometimes
under the outer skin (epidermis) of the tender branches. The larvae leave the
outer skin intact and thus give rise to transparent white shiny zigzag
galleries. As a result of the attack a
large number of leaves turn pale, curl up and eventually dry up. This kind of
damage to nursery plants results in the complete loss of root stock.<br>

The adult moths are very
small in size, silvery white in colour with prominent black eyes. The wing
expanse is 5 mm. The forewings are brown and striped with a prominent black
spot near the apical margin. The hind pair or wings are white. Both the pairs
of wings are fringed with minute hairs.
    The citrus leaf miner (CLM) is native to Asia and is
found throughout the continent and beyond. The full grown caterpillar remains in the galleries tunneled below the
epidermis of the leaf tissue.

Title: Groundnut Caterpillar
Authors: R.   Rajkumar
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The groundnut caterpillar, <em>Spodoptera litura</em>, appears on groundnut
both in vegetative phase and at the time of pod formation. It feeds initially
by skeletonizing, leaving only the outline of the leaves and veins on the
plant. As growth continues, caterpillars eat the entire leaves. After December,
particularly after heavy rains, the infestation increases.
    The adult female moth lays eggs in masses of
200-300 on the underside of the groundnut leaves. The egg masses are
approximately 4-7 mm in diameter, brown in colour and are covered with body
hair. Eggs usually hatch after 3- 4 days. Fully grown caterpillars measure
about 3-5 cm in length. They feed gregariously by scrapping the chlorophyll.
Sometimes the feeding is so heavy that only the petiole (the stalk that
attaches the leaf to the stem) and branches are left behind. The old larvae are
nocturnal and can be found on the soil around the base of the plant during the
day time. When the population is high, the larvae migrate from one field to another
in search of food.

Title: Groundnut Leaf Miner
Authors: Manju   Thakur
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The groundnut leaf miner is a key pest of
groundnut. The damage to groundnut is caused by both larval and adult stages.
The adult is a tiny moth measuring about 6 mm in length with brownish grey
coloured wings. The larvae mine the leaves and feed inside the leaflet.
Initially, short blister-like mines can be seen on the upper side of the
leaflets. The larvae come out of the mine after 5-6 days and migrate together
to nearby leaves to feed and pupate in the webbed leaves. The mined areas in
the leaf become dry. In severe infestation, the entire foliage dries and gives
a burnt appearance.
    The groundnut leaf miner attacks both rainy
season and post-rainy season crops. Its incidence is severe July-August and
February-March and the losses can vary from 25 to 75%. Soybean is also one of
its important hosts.
    This pest can be managed using cultural
control measures, resistant varieties, biological control agents and by
spraying chemicals only when the
pest population is above the economic threshold level (ETL).<br>

Title: Management of Parawilt Disease in Cotton
Authors: Vijay S Thokre
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The incidence is particularly
high in plants with a large canopy and heavy boll load. Leaves of affected
plants show wilt like drooping, become chlorotic and turn bronze or red
followed by drying. Premature dropping of leaves and fruiting parts may occur.
Leaves lose turgidity and become wilted due to increased water loss. Squares
and young bolls are shed and immature bolls are forcefully opened. Wilted
plants show development of anthocyanin pigment, giving a red appearance. Most
of the wilted plants gradually recover and produce new flushes but their
contribution to yield is small.
    Parawilt causes considerable
concern amongst cotton growers across the country. It is also known as sudden
wilt. Unlike pathogenic wilt, which occurs in groups of plants in fields, it is
difficult to quantify the incidence and the yield loss of parawilt. Detailed
investigations on isolation, distribution pattern and pathogen transmission
proved that fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes were not involved in this
problem. The cause of Parawilt could not be proven until recently, mainly
because of its random occurrence and inability to simulate the wilt under
artificial conditions.<br>
</br>
These plants exhibit high
photosynthesis and transpiration (water loss) rates. Consequently, for the production
of proteins and other food, these plants require a high uptake of nutrients.
Nutrient uptake, which is an active process and inhibited under anaerobic
(water-logged) conditions. As a result of the feedback inhibition of root
respiration, the root system degenerates in wilted plants. Damage to the roots
affects their ability to take up and move water to the rest of the plant. This,
coupled with higher transpiration in wilted plants due to their insensitive
stomata, causes parawilt in cotton.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Provide adequate drainage to avoid water logging of the fields</li>
    <li>Irrigation may be provided during grand growth phase to avoid prolonged
    exposure of plants to dry conditions</li>

Title: Pod Fly in Pigeon pea
Authors: T.   Aruna
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The adult is small black fly and
is about 5 mm in length. Eggs are laid in the wall of an immature pod. The
female pod fly lays individual eggs on the developing pods. The pod fly
infested pods do not show any external symptom of damage until the fully-grown
larvae chew the pod wall. They leave behind a thin, papery membrane called a
window, through which adults exit the pods. The white maggots feed on the
developing grain and pupate inside the pod. The pupae bore the grains and make
the tunnel in them. The damaged grains do not germinate and are unfit for human
consumption.
    The pod fly is a major pest in pigeon pea. Infestation
of pod flies causes damage to 20-80% of the crop. The pod fly attack remains
unnoticed by the farmers owing to the hidden lifestyle of the insect and thus
it becomes difficult to manage.

developing grain and pupate inside the pod. The pupae bore the grains and make
the tunnel in them. The damaged grains do not germinate and are unfit for human
consumption. The pod fly is a major pest in pigeon pea. Infestation
of pod flies causes damage to 20-80% of the crop. The pod fly attack remains
unnoticed by the farmers owing to the hidden lifestyle of the insect and thus
it becomes difficult to manage. <ul>

Title: Powdery mildew in Green gram
Authors: Vaishali   Londase
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    A powder appears in patches on
leaves and other green parts of the plant. This powder is white but later turns
a dull colour. Gradually, the powdery patches grow and become circular until
they also cover the lower surface of the leaf. In severe infections, leaves
turn yellow and fall early. Severely affected parts shrivel and become
distorted. The disease causes forced maturity and therefore reduced crop yields.
    This is a major yield-limiting factor in green
gram. Among the various diseases, powdery mildew is a very common problem in
cool, dry weather. This pathogen is an obligate parasite and has a wide host
range. It survives in conidial form on
various hosts in the off-season. The losses caused by powdery mildews in India are
tremendous, particularly in the yield of peas, grapes, cereals and cucurbits.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Diseased
    debris should be collected and burnt in the field</li>
    <li>Early
    varieties should be preferred</li>
    <li>Sowing

    <li>Powdery
    mildew could be controlled by spraying Carbendazim (0.05%) and Penconazole
    (0.05%)</li>
    <li>Two
    sprays of Tridemorph 1 ml per litre; one dose immediately after the disease
    appearance and the second dose 15 days later</li>

Title: Cercospora Leaf Spot in Sesame
Authors: Vaishali   Londase
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Sesame is an important
oilseed crop. The crop suffers from many fungal, bacterial, viral and
phytoplasmal diseases. Cercospora
leaf spot, caused by the fungus&nbsp;<em>Cercospora
sesami,</em>&nbsp;infects all above
ground parts of the plant, resulting in complete defoliation which leads to
severe economic losses. The disease, which affects leaves as early as 4 weeks
after planting, starts as small pinhead-sized cottony spots on the infected
leaves. These spots gradually spread on the lamina and can extend up to 4 mm in
diameter. Extensive infection leads to defoliation and damage of capsules before
the plant reaches maturity which can result in yield losses of 20 to 50%.
    The fungal spores are
spread to healthy plants through rain, irrigation water and wind. Germination
occurs in humid conditions, usually during late spring and summer, and fungus growth
is encouraged when leaves are frequently damp.

Title: Red Palm Weevil of Coconut
Authors: Mr   Murugan

Sections:
    The red

palm weevil is one of the major pests infesting palm crops like coconut, sago and

other palm trees. On the infested trees, a reddish

brown liquid is seen oozing out from the hole in the stem close to the ground. The liquid gives off a rotten smell.
    The red palm weevil is one of the

most destructive pests of coconut. The grubs cause damage inside the stem and

crown by feeding on soft tissues. When the infestation is severe, the inside

portion of trunk is completely eaten and replaced by rotten fibres.
    <ul>

    <li>

    the soil deeply around the coconut trunk in April-May to make a trench for the grubs

    to fall in to. Hand-pick the grubs and kill them.</li>

    <li>Use

    the wounds on the trees and leaf axis with a mixture of 10% carbaryl and clay

    (1:1). The rest of the holes on the trees should be closed prior to the

    treatment so that the pest does not escape from them.</li>

    <li>Select

    young feeder roots by digging around the tree trunk. Mix a root feeding of carbosulfan

    25% EC @ 10 ml/ 15 ml of water.&nbsp; Cut the

    root at an angle to give it a slanting cut. The cut portion of the root is then

    immersed in the insecticidal solution kept in polythene bags so that the cut

    end is dipped up to the bottom of the polythene bag.&nbsp; The polythene bag is then tied with jute

    string. The root absorbs the entire quantity within four days.</li>

    <li>Select

Title: Sugarcane Woolly Aphids
Authors: Ms.    Girija
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The sugarcane woolly aphid is a pest

that has profuse white coloured woolly coating around it. It is often mistaken

for a mealybug. The white powder on the

ground and leaves confirms the presence of the aphids. If uncontrolled,

it spreads very quickly and can cause yield losses of up to 20%.&nbsp;This pest is locally known as &ldquo;Panju asuvini&rdquo; (Tamil). The nymphs and adults of the aphid remain on the under surface of the leaves and suck the sap. The pests feed voraciously and convert excess sugar into honeydew. The honeydew secretion will lead to the growth of sooty mould fungus.
    &nbsp;The incidence of this pest starts immediately after rainy

season and becomes severe during summer and when there are prolonged dry spells

coupled with high relative humidity. The pest is transmitted by wind as well as

by the transportation of sett and cane from an affected field to other areas. The

pest survives on the ratoon crop as well as on hosts like grasses and banana

during the off season.
    <ul>

Title: Bhendi Vein Clearing Virus
Authors: S.   Malarvannan, Vijay S Thokre
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    This is a viral disease occurring on bhendi (Okra/Lady&rsquo;s Finger). Yellowing of the entire network of veins in the leaf blade is the

characteristic symptom. In severe infections, the younger leaves turn yellow to

become entirely chlorotic and the plant is highly stunted. The veins of the

leaves will be cleared by the virus and interveinal area becomes completely

yellow or white. The veins become considerably

thickened. The infection may start at any stage of plant

growth. Infection restricts flowering and fruits, if formed, may be smaller and

harder. The affected plants produce fruits with yellow or white colour and they

are not fit for marketing.
    Bhendi vein clearing virus is a serious disease of Bhendi and causes huge

economic loss. The virus is spread by an insect

called a whitefly (<em>Bemisia tabaci</em>) that sucks the cell sap from the

underside of the leaves. The infection may start at any stage of plant growth

Title: Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
Authors: R.   Ramesh, S.   Mathiyazhagan, K.   Rajappan, M.   Malarvannan
Editors: <?>
Sections:
    Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) is a
major problem on tomato, particularly in Tamil Nadu. Once the disease has
occurred, it will spread fast and drastically reduce the yield. Symptoms of
infection include stunted plants, reduced leaf size, upward cupping/curling
of leaves, chlorosis on leaves and reduced fruit production. Leaves are often
bent downward and may be thicker than normal leaves. Flowers may appear
normal but can sometimes bear no fruit, or, can bear fruit but significantly
reduced in size. Affected plants tend to be distributed in isolated patches.
The new growth of plants with TYLCV can have reduced internodes, giving the
plant a stunted appearance. This virus can cause significant yield losses
from 80-100%
    TYLCV is known as the most destructive disease of tomato
and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions, causing severe economic
losses. TYLCV
is transmitted through a vector and harboured inside infected plants; it is
not transmitted through seed or soil.&nbsp;
The disease is transmitted by white fly (<em>Bemisia tabaci</em>). The
primary host for TYLCV is the tomato plant. Other plant hosts of TYLCV
include eggplant, potato, tobacco, beans, and peppers. Due to the rapid
spread of TYLCV in the last few decades, there is an increased focus in
research trying to understand and control this disease.

Title: Chickpea Wilt
Authors: Vijay S Thokre
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Chickpea wilt caused by <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> f. sp. <em>ciceris</em> is one of the major yield limiting factors in chickpea and is also known as &ldquo;Mar disease&rdquo; in Marathi. The disease causes 10&ndash;90% yield losses annually in chickpea. When the disease occurs at seedling stage, seedlings collapse and lie flat on the soil surface. In adult plants, the characteristic symptom is a brown to black discoloration of the xylem vessels in the stem. Affected plants appear in patches in the field.
    The fungus may survive in seeds or in soil. The disease is more severe in light sandy soil than heavy clay. High soil temperature and lack of moisture appear to have a definite bearing on its incidence. The higher the organic matter in the soil, the lower the incidence of wilt. The development of wilt is favored by an increase in nitrogen. The optimum temperature and pH for the pathogen are 25&deg;C and pH 5-6.5 respectively. A delay in sowing helps to minimize the disease.
    <ul>

<li>Follow deep summer ploughing</li>

<li>Follow crop rotation measures continuously with unrelated crops e.g. wheat, barley or oats</li>

<li>Always use disease free seeds</li>

<li>Avoid sowing when temperature is high</li>

<li>Apply castor cake 500 kg/ha at the time of sowing</li>

<li>Treat seeds with <em>Trichoderma viride</em> @ 4 g/kg seed or with carbendazim @ 2 g/kg. Do not use both of these treatments as the chemical will kill the biological control agent.</li>

</ul>
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Sugarcane Early shoot borer
Authors: T.   Aruna
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The sugarcane early shoot borer is a serious problem in sugarcane. 1-3 month old crops are highly susceptible. The caterpillars of the shoot borer cause dead hearts in young plants. The young plants with dead hearts formed at shoot stage can be pulled out easily. The canes are damaged and also produce a foul odour. The central whorl of leaves dries up in the damaged plants.
    The symptoms described above are caused by an insect called a shoot borer. The adults, which are small pale greyish brown moths, lay white flat eggs in clusters of 8-60 eggs in 3 to 5 rows on the under surface of the leaf sheaths. The larvae, which hatch from the eggs in 1-6 days, get scattered and enter the stem by making a hole just above the ground level. It becomes fully grown in 25-30 days and pupates inside the stem. An adult moth emerges after 6-8 days. The total life cycle is completed in 35-40 days. The bore holes can be seen above the ground level.

Title: Pulse Beetle
Authors: Vijay S Thokre
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Pulse beetles are serious pests of stored pulses like pigeon pea, green gram, black gram, cowpea and chickpea. The white coloured eggs hatch after 4 to 5 days. The grub makes a hole inside the grain which causes heavy damage. This reduces the quality as well as market prices. Adults are 4.5 mm long and heart shaped.
    This is a primary pest of stored pulses. Infestation starts in the field and continues in the store. The grubs penetrate grains and feed on the inner content. Infested grains are unfit for human consumption and cannot be used as seeds. Maximum damage occurs when conditions are favourable i.e. an optimum temperature of 30&deg;C and relative humidity of 70%. This pest completes its life cycle in 25 to 40 days and causes heavy yield losses. The pest can be effectively managed using various physical methods.
    All the stages of pulse beetle in seeds could be killed by exposing them to temperatures of up to 45&deg;C for varying periods, or by exposing them to sunlight for 4 to 6 hours with the diurnal temperature varying from 37 - 45&deg;C. Viability of the treated grains not will be adversely affected. <br />

<ul>

<li>Clean the warehouses and storage places with brushes, scrapers or a vacuum cleaner, then destroy any collected insect</li>

</ul>

<p>For storing the grains, use any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mix ash with grains</li>

<li>Use neem leaves at @ 1 kg / 100g of grains</li>

<li>Apply neem oil @ 8-10ml / kg seed, fenvalerate 0.4% @ 4 gm/kg seed, malathion 50EC @ 0.06ml/kg seed or deltamethrin 2.8 EC (0.04ml)/ kg for seed treatment</li>

<li>Dust with 5% malathion</li>

Title: Cotton Mealybug Management
Authors: Bhavana   Kolhe
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    The cotton mealybug is a sucking pest of cotton and sucks the cell sap from the leaves, fruit and twigs. Serious attacks result in delayed growth and late opening of bolls which severely affects yield. It feeds on soft tissues and injects saliva, which causes curling of the leaves. Mealybugs secrete a sugary substance on which black sooty mould growth is observed. This also attracts ant colonies.
    The mealybug body is covered with very short waxy filaments. It spreads from the borders of the field. It is a polyphagous pest and feeds on various crops and weeds, etc. In initial stages, it can be observed in small pockets. More damage occurs during dry weather conditions. The main vector of their transmission is ants but they also get transmitted by humans, water, air, etc. Therefore, controlling ants will allow predators to feed on mealybugs, reducing their numbers.
    <ul>

<li>Use crop rotation practices and burn the plant debris to maintain the field sanitation</li>

<li>Remove or avoid growing the alternate host plants of mealybug such as <em>Parthenium</em> spp., datura, milkweed, <em>Chenopodium</em> spp., okra, tomato and brinjal near cotton fields</li>

<li>Remove and burn the affected plant parts</li>

<li>Encourage the activity of predators like <em>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</em> and <em>Cheilomenes sexmaculata</em>, commonly known as ladybird beetles</li>

<li>Locate the ant colonies and destroy them by drenching with chlorpyriphos 50EC @ 2.5 ml/ litres of water</li>

<li>If the infestation continues, use any one insecticide and add detergent powder 20gm / 10 lit of water for the degradation of the waxy coating</li>

<li>After harvesting, store cotton sticks away from the fields and if possible a barrier of insecticide (e.g. malathion dusting) should be made around the stacks to reduce the carry over to the next crop</li>

Title: Yellow stem borer on paddy
Authors: C  Chandramohan, Ramana  Murthy, S R Ingle
Editors: Eric
Sections:
    Yellow stem borer is the most damaging insect on paddy. It feeds inside the plant. Stems become dry and hollow and no grains are produced. The dried stems can be pulled out easily and are called dead hearts. The empty grains are known as white ears and detach easily.
    The insect has two different forms. The adult insect is usually a yellowish moth with a black dot on each wing and has a pointed mouth. The adults visit the fields in the evening. The young larvae or worms are found inside the stem and are off white with a red head and no visible legs.<br /> The larva is thin with a rough surface and looks like a small tube. They cause much damage by boring into the stem and eating the plant. Only one larva is found in each stem although several stems can be affected.
    There are no resistant varieties of rice and chemical sprays are not effective once the larvae are hidden inside in the stem.<br /> Early treatment of young plants helps to reduce damage in fields. In raised beds of seedlings spread <em>Cartap HCL </em>10G evenly. This is an approved granular insecticide that dissolves in water and remains within the plant. A raised bed of one foot by 10 feet will need around 13 grams of<em> Cartap HCL 10G</em>.<br /> After transplanting seedlings, and within 10 days, place pheromone dispensers containing sex pheromone tablets in the paddy field. These will attract adult moths and reduce populations of larvae. Place 32 dispensers per acre, evenly spaced. These should remain in the field till harvest. There is no need to replace the tablets during this time.
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Cabbage aphid
Authors: R.  Manjesh
Editors: Eric
Sections:
    Cabbage aphids are small insects which damage plants at all stages and reduce the value of the crop. Locally they are called <em>beli henu</em>. They are dull green with a white, waxy surface and often occur in dense groups. They are easy to identify.
    Cabbage aphids feed on both sides of young and tender leaves. They breed very quickly and populations increase rapidly during hot and humid conditions.<br /> Large numbers of aphids can kill seedlings. On older plants, leaves curl and become yellow as they die, plant growth is stunted and cabbage heads are deformed.
    Management options include prevention and control.<br /> PREVENTION: check the seedlings regularly for aphids. If the seedling is heavily infested do not use as transplants.<br /> NATURE'S CONTROL: Less use of insecticides helps to maintain a healthy balance of helpful insects which feed on aphids.<br /> ORGANIC CONTROL: Treat early to keep aphids in check. Insecticidal soaps such as LASTRAW are applied at 5 millilitres per litre of water. Spray two times each week for three weeks when the pest is present in the field<br /> CHEMICAL CONTROL: If the pest still persists spray with insecticides such as Acetamiprid, Chloropyriphos and Imidacloprid, at recommended doses. Granular insecticides can be applied to soil during transplanting of seedlings.
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Leaf curl disease on tomato
Authors: S. K Ghosh, V. S Mahesh
Editors: Eric
Sections:
    Leaf curl is a virus disease which reduces yields severely. The disease can be confused with other problems such as tomato yellow top disease, low temperature damage and poor soils. The distinctive feature of leaf curl disease apart from the curling is severe stunting of plants, particularly in seedlings.
    The disease is caused by a germ (virus) and is spread by a small sucking insect called whitefly. The whiteflies inject the germ into healthy plants. The whiteflies occur on the underside of the leaf and fly away when the plant is disturbed.<br /> The virus is not transmitted in seed, soil or by handling plants. Weeds can carry the virus but they do not show any symptoms.<br /> Diseased plants grow slowly, have smaller yellow leaves, are stunted and produce less fruit. The edges of leaves curl unevenly in different directions and have a rough surface. The flowers and fruits appear healthy. Infected seedlings have bushy growth.
    There is no chemical control for leaf curl disease. There are other methods which help control the spread of whiteflies and the disease.

<ul>

<li>Raise the seedlings under protective netting (less than 50 mesh size) supported by small wooden sticks.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Control weeds in fields by covering the soil with paddy straw or similar material or use plastic sheeting.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>LASTRAW is an insecticidal soap which can help control whiteflies. Spray twice a week for three weeks.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>At the early stages of disease development, when only a few plants show leaf curl symptoms, remove and burn.</li>

</ul>

Tomato varieties tolerant to leaf curl disease are available but are not currently sold in India.
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Root knot nematode on tomato
Authors: Anusha  Babbar, Malvika  Chaudhary, Rekha  Powar
Editors: Eric
Sections:
    Tomato roots are attacked by nematodes, reducing growth of the plant and yields. The symptoms above ground are similar to other diseases. Confirm nematode attack by examining the roots.
    Nematodes or <em>Jantu hula</em> are small worms which live in the soil, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. They can persist for many years, even after the infected plant has been removed. Nursery soil is a common source of nematodes.<br /> How to recognize tomato nematode:

<ul>

<li>distinctive swellings or knots on the roots</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>the plant is stunted (it cannot absorb enough food)</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>leaves go yellow and die</li>

</ul>

Nematodes attack many plants. Knots are often confused with nodules found on the roots of crops such as cowpea and bean. These nodules help the plant to grow.
    <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> is a natural control method. SU-MONAS is one example of a commercial preparation. When applied to the soil it helps tomato plants fight nematodes. Treat nursery soil to prevent transfer of nematodes to fields.

<ul>

<li>In the nursery apply SU-MONAS at 50 grams per square metre of soil.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>In case of infected seedlings, broadcast the field with well decomposed farmyard manure (1 ton per acre) enriched by SU-MONAS at 2 kilograms per 100 kilograms of farmyard manure. Apply this treatment before you transplant the seedlings.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Intercrop every 25 rows of tomato with one row of marigold. Their root juices kill nematodes.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Ensure good drainage after irrigation by keeping the ridge height of the seedling bed up to 8-10 inches.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Do not plant tomatoes continuously. Rotate every six months with fodder crops such as sorghum which are not attacked by nematodes.</li>

</ul>

Chemical control of nematodes in the soil is available but expensive.
    When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.

Title: Irrigation Quality
Authors: S. G Matale
Editors: CABI
Sections:
    Irrigation with impure or poor quality water will have a negative effect on the soil properties and, ultimately, on crop fertility and yield. The constitution and concentration of salts in water can have negative effect on soil.
    Farmers use irrigation water without following the scientific guidelines. Total salt concentration is the most important standard for judging the irrigation quality. Irrigation scheduling should be based on the water requirement of the crop.
    The suitability of irrigation water is based on the classification and concentration of salts in water. <br /> <br /> C1 low salinity - suitable for most soil <br /> C2 medium salinity - suitable with moderate drainage <br /> C3 high salinity - unsuitable under restricted condition <br /> C4 very high salinity - unsuitable<br /> <br />

<ul>

<li>Drain excess water from the field</li>

<li>Use gypsum (to measure soil moisture) along with land treatments</li>

<li>Use green manures and crop residues to develop the physical properties of soil</li>

Content:
Irrigation with impure or poor quality water will have a negative effect on the soil properties and, ultimately, on crop fertility and yield. The constitution and concentration of salts in water can have negative effect on soil. Farmers use irrigation water without following the scientific guidelines. Total salt concentration is the most important standard for judging the irrigation quality. Irrigation scheduling should be based on the water requirement of the crop. The suitability of irrigation water is based on the classification and concentration of salts in water. <br /> <br /> C1 low salinity - suitable for most soil <br /> C2 medium salinity - suitable with moderate drainage <br /> C3 high salinity - unsuitable under restricted condition <br /> C4 very high salinity - unsuitable<br /> <br />

<ul>

<li>Drain excess water from the field</li>

<li>Use gypsum (to measure soil moisture) along with land treatments</li>

<li>Use green manures and crop residues to develop the physical properties of soil</li>

Do not do this when conditions are wet since the disease can be spread by people and tools<br/>-&nbsp;Disinfect hands and tools after working on the infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease to healthy plants. Use household bleach or 5% sodium hypochloride<br/>-&nbsp;Water in the morning so the leaves can dry in the sun<br/>-&nbsp;Avoid planting during wet and cool periods<br/>-&nbsp;Use dry mulch to reduce water splash and therefore avoid spread of disease<br/>-&nbsp;Apply recommended rates of nitrogen fertilizer as high rates increase likelihood of disease<br/>-&nbsp;Remove and burn debris from tomatoes and other solanaceous crops (potato, peppers and eggplant) after harvest<br/>-&nbsp;Do not plant solaneceous crops (e.g. tomato, Irish potato, pepper, eggplan, nightshade) on land that suffered from the disease in the previous season or near land that currently suffers from the disease<br/>-&nbsp;Practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops such as beans, sweet potato, maize, cowpea, soybean, groundnuts, onion, carrots for 2 growing seasons<br/>
    -&nbsp;Monitor twice at least week for symptoms and on a daily basis during the raining season since wet and humid conditions favour the disease<br/>-&nbsp;Look for irregular greasy greyish patches on the leaves which expand rapdily under damp/humid conditions. These patches are an early symptom of the disease<br/>-&nbsp;Look for brown elongated lesions on the stems and brown-green blotches or spots on the tomato fruits. These are symptoms of the later stages of the disease<br/>-&nbsp;Look for white downy moulds at the margin of affected areas on the lower leaf surface<br/>-&nbsp;When dry weather is expected, some infection symptoms might be tolerated and infected plant parts can be removed. When wet, cool weather (< 24°C) is expected, 2-4 plants with symptoms per ¼ acre are enough to consider quick action.<br/>
    -&nbsp;If plant parts show early symptoms, remove the infected plant parts in dry conditions. Carry the diseased materials away in a closed container to prevent spreading the disease. Burn the planting material or bury to at least 1 m deep. Do not compost<br/>-&nbsp;Neem has a slight anti-fungal effect. Spray 50 ml of neem oil with some soap per 10 litres of water within 8 hours of mixing, and every 7-14 days until no more fungal infection appears. Ask your local input suppliers to organise such products if neem trees do not grow in your area.<br/>-&nbsp;If the plants are badly infected/show later symptoms then remove the entire plants in dry conditions.

Editors: 
Sections:
    -&nbsp;Bean seed fly is a pest that feed on the swollen, ungerminated seed of vegetable crops at larval stage, called maggot.<br/>-&nbsp;The use of winter cover crops (e.g. grasses) may increase fly populations, if this is needed then plant bean crop 3.5 weeks after the cover crop has been incorportated into the soil.<br/>-&nbsp;Avoid planting during wet periods to reduce infestation of maggots. Plant crops when the weather and soil promotes rapid germination to reduce impact of maggots.<br/>-&nbsp;Remove flowering weeds from the area to reduce nearby food sources for flies.<br/>
    -&nbsp;When monitoring fields, look out for wilting plants and gaps in vegetation where seedlings have failed to emerge. To identify maggots, search in the soil around these areas. <br/>-&nbsp;Maggots can also be found tunneling up the stem of newly emerged seedlings.<br/>-&nbsp;Eggs: 1-2 mm long, white eggs.<br/>-&nbsp;Larvae: Up to 10 mm long, white maggots. Pupae are brown and are up to 7 mm long.<br/>-&nbsp;Adults: Small, grey bodied flies, up to 5.2 mm long.<br/>-&nbsp;The symptoms can be confused with wireworm feeding injury and dieback<br/>
    -&nbsp;The only method for controlling <i>D. platura</i> is targeting the maggot stage. Seed treatments are the cheapest and most effective control for maggots.<br/>
